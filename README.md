random password generator that generates a random password of a user-defined length description
A random password generator is a tool that automatically creates a password based on guidelines that you set to help protect your accounts and sensitive information. These tools create complex, randomized passwords that protect against unauthorized access.

Here's how it works:

1)Length: The user specifies the length of the password. Longer passwords are generally more secure than shorter ones.

2)Character set: The password can include different types of characters, such as:

Lowercase letters (a-z) Uppercase letters (A-Z) Digits (0-9) Special characters (e.g., @, #, $, %, etc.)

3)Randomness: The password generator randomly selects characters from the allowed set, up to the desired length. Randomness ensures that the password is not easily guessable.
